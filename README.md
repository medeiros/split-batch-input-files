This library splits a file in several, so an ETL mechanism (like Spring 
Batch) is able to read data in parallel, improving overall performance.

This is a library to be used Java applications.

Created in Clojure functional language.

Todo list:

- add function to remove generated files
- ~~add unit tests~~
- ~~add file to Leiningen project, in order to generate a lib jar~~
